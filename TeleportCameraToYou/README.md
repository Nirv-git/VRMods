# TeleportCameraToYou
Another ultra simple mod, this puts a button on the UIX _Camera_ QuickMenu that teleports the Viewfinder of your camera right in front of your face. This is useful if you left it somewhere far away, or are using a small avatar. 

In mod settings there is one preference, the distance from your head the camera gets teleported to.
