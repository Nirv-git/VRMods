This is a collection of a few simple mods I have made. 
They all require [Melon Loader](https://melonwiki.xyz/#/README?id=installation-on-il2cpp-games) and [UIExpansionKit](https://github.com/knah/VRCMods/)

# VRC-CameraResChanger
Another simple mod that does just one thing! This uses [UIExpansionKit](https://github.com/knah/VCRCMods/) to add a few buttons to your camera menu, allowing you to set the VRC camera resolution to, Default (1920x1080), 4K (3840x2160), 6k (5760x3240), 8k (7680x4320).

Couple notes: 
* Larger resolutions will cause your game to hang for a few seconds while it renders the image, I have not had VRC crash outright though, but in one instance an 8k photo took 30 seconds.   
* Thanks to [Lag Free Screenshots](https://github.com/knah/VRCMods#lag-free-screenshots) I was silly and added a 16k option if that mod is also installed.
  *  Note, make sure you have a good amount of RAM free. A friend of mine recently mentioned that he was having issues with this and I checked and a 16k photo spikes RAM usage by 6GB  
  * __Resolutions greater than 8k may randomly break with new VRC versions__
* This will not work with Virtual Lens, that camera has a lot of hard coded resolution values in it's shaders. Using anything but the default resolution will just result in a picture of you.Â **VRCLens** will work with the 4k option though (if you set the camera prefab to use it when you add it to your avatar)

I would also recommend [CameraMinus](https://github.com/knah/VRCMods) for some other camera QoL.
