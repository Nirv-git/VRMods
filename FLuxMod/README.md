# FLuxMod
Adds [VRChat Flux Bloom Removal Shader](https://rollthered.booth.pm/items/3092302) with controls via **[ActionMenuAPI](https://api.vrcmg.com/v0/mods/201/ActionMenuApi.dll)**     
This is normally intended to go on an avatar to be used to limit bloom, bright highlights and other visual adjustments.    
Included are 6 save slots for presets. Slot names can be changed in Mod Settings.    
Due to how AMAPI handles radials I made it so at 97% the puppets are maxed out.
