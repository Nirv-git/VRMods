# IKTpresets
Another mod that screws with the preferences of IKTweaks! I made this to be able to quickly change preferences when switching between avatars and to make it easier to tune the settings for an avatar. 
Features 16 slots to save presets to and a UIX based QuickMenu editor of common settings.
