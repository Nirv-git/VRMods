# VRC-ToggleIKTAnim
Did you like having a button you could pin to your QuickMenu to quickly toggle movement animations with IKTweaks? This ultra simple mod adds a toggle to your QM that forcefully sets the preference for IgnoreAnimationsMode betweek "None" and "All".    
It is simple, dirty, but works!
