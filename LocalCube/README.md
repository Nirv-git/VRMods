# VRC-LocalCube
Did you ever just not want to see the rest of the world? This mod gives you that ability! Now you can spawn a cube around you that only you can see!   

The silly inspiration for this mod was VRC reconnecting me to a world while I was sleeping, the sleep area is dark, but spawn is super bright. Obvious answer is to make a mod to make a black cube to hide the blinding light! 

Also has been useful at times for just using a wall from the cube to hide certain parts of the map when they bug out. Don't need to worry about the seizure textures if you just hide them!
